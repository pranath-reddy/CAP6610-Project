## VAEs and GANs Comparative Analysis

This repository contains the code and resources for a comprehensive comparative analysis of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using MNIST and CelebA datasets. The goal of this project is to evaluate the performance of VAEs and GANs in generating diverse and realistic samples and to assist researchers and practitioners in selecting the most appropriate generative model for their specific applications and datasets.
